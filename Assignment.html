			<h1>H1: Number of cat stickers</h1>
			<p>There is currently one cat sticker on my laptop.  It is of a black cat inside of a fencing mask.  The cat appears to be sleeping.  The sticker is near the keyboard portion of my laptop.
			</p>
			<h3>H3: Other stickers on my laptop:</h3>
			<p>There are 2 other stickers on my laptop, currently.  One of those is of a girl reading a book and the other is of Captain Flint hugging a stuffed walrus.

					“This is how they survive. You must know this. You're too smart <strong>not</strong> to know this.</p>
					<p>They paint the world full of shadows... And then tell their children to stay close to the light. Their light. Their reasons, their judgments... Because in the darkness, there be dragons. But it isn't true! We can prove that it isn't true! In the dark, there is discovery, there is possibility, there is freedom in the dark once someone has illuminated it.</p>
					
					<p>All this will have been for nothing. <strong>We</strong> will have been for nothing. Defined by their histories... distorted to fit into their narrative... until all that is left of us are the monsters in the stories they tell their children.”

			<h6>H6: How many of the others are near the keyboard:</h6>
			<p>Zero.  No other stickers are near the keyboard.  The cat is the only one.  The other two are on the outside cover of my laptop.
