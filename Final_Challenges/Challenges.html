                <h2>The Raven</h2>
                <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<Br>
                    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore ‚Äî<br>
                    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, <br>
                    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. <br>
                    ‚Äú ‚ÄôTis some visitor,‚Äù I muttered, ‚Äútapping at my chamber door ‚Äî <br>
                    Only this and nothing more.‚Äù<Br>
                </p>
                    
                <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; <br>
                    And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. <Br>
                    Eagerly I wished the morrow;‚Äîvainly I had sought to borrow <br>
                    From my books surcease of sorrow‚Äîsorrow for the lost Lenore ‚Äî <br>
                    For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore ‚Äî <br>
                    Nameless here for evermore. <Br>
                </p>

                <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain <br>
                    Thrilled me‚Äîfilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; <br>
                    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating <br>
                    ‚Äú ‚ÄôTis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door ‚Äî <br>
                    Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; <br>
                    This it is and nothing more.‚Äù <br>
                </p>

                <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, <br>
                    ‚ÄúSir,‚Äù said I, ‚Äúor Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; <br>
                    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, <br>
                    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, <br>
                    That I scarce was sure I heard you‚Äù ‚Äî here I opened wide the door; <br>
                    Darkness there and nothing more. <br>
                </p>

                <h2>A Dream within a Dream</h2>
                <h3>by Edgar Allan Poe</h3>
                <p>Take this kiss upon the brow! <br>
                    And, in parting from you now, <br>
                    Thus much let me avow ‚Äî <br>
                    You are not wrong, who deem <br>
                    That my days have been a dream; <br>
                    Yet if hope has flown away <br>
                    In a night, or in a day, <br>
                    In a vision, or in none, <br>
                    Is it therefore the less gone? <br>
                    All that we see or seem <br>
                    Is but a dream within a dream. <br>
                </p>
                    
                <p>I stand amid the roar <br>
                    Of a surf-tormented shore, <br>
                    And I hold within my hand <br>
                    Grains of the golden sand ‚Äî <br>
                    How few! yet how they creep <br>
                    Through my fingers to the deep, <br>
                    While I weep ‚Äî while I weep! <br>
                    O God! Can I not grasp <br>
                    Them with a tighter clasp? <br>
                    O God! can I not save <br>
                    One from the pitiless wave? <br>
                    Is all that we see or seem <br>
                    But a dream within a dream? <br>
